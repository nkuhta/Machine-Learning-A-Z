If your problem is linear, you should go for Simple Linear Regression, 
if you only have one feature, 
Multiple Linear Regression if you have several features.

If your problem is non linear, 
you should go for Polynomial Regression, SVR, 
Decision Tree or Random Forest. 

Then which one should you choose among these four ? 
That you will learn in Part 10 - Model Selection. 
The method consists of using a very relevant technique 
that evaluates your models performance, 
called k-Fold Cross Validation, 
and then picking the model that shows the best results.
